# Nightmare on FX street

IntelliJ IDEA + Gradle + JavaFX into a single fat jar.

Truly a horrendous nightmare.

### Build a Fat Jar
```
./gradlew fatJar
```

or from the IDEA Gradle menu `other->fatJar`

# Now being used as the Repo for VaccSpace

its like my sejahtera but made in java and slightly worse.
